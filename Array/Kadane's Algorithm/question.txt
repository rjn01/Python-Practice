Given an array arr of N integers. Find the contiguous sub-array with maximum sum.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {1,2,3,-2,5}
Output: 9
Explanation: Max subarray sum is 9
of elements (1, 2, 3, -2, 5) which 
is a contiguous subarray.

Example 2:

Input:
N = 4
arr[] = {-1,-2,-3,-4}
Output: -1
Explanation: Max subarray sum is -1 
of element (-1)

Your Task:
The task is to complete the function maxSubarraySum() which returns the sum of subarray with maximum sum.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
