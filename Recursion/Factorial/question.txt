You are given a number n. You need to recursively find the factorial of n and return it.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 5
Output: 120

Example 2:

Input:
n = 0
Output: 1

Your Task:

Complete the function factorial that takes n as parameter and returns the factorial. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N) (Recursive).
