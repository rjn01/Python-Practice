Print numbers from 1 to N without the help of loops.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 10
Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10


Example 2:

Input:
N = 5
Output: 1 2 3 4 5

 

Your Task:
This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function printNos() that takes N as parameter and prints number from 1 to N recursively. The driver code adds the newline automatically after the function call.
