Given an array a[ ] of size N. The task is to check if array is sorted or not. A sorted array can either be increasingly sorted or decreasingly sorted. Also consider duplicate elements to be sorted.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
a[] = {1 1 2 2 3}
Output: 1

Example 2:

Input:
N = 2
a[] = {4 2}
Output: 1

Your Task:
You just need to complete the function isSorted() that takes arr and n as parameters and returns 0 if arr is unsorted and returns 1 if arr is sorted.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).
